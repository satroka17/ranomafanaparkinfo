                           <br><br>Ecotourism provides essential revenue that directly funds conservation efforts in Ranomafana. Income from entrance fees, guided tours, and other park-related activities is often reinvested in maintaining the park, protecting its wildlife, and supporting critical biodiversity research. Since 1991, Madagascar National Parks (MNP) has managed Ranomafana National Park and the endemic flora and fauna within it. MNP is a private association recognized for its public interest, operating under the supervision of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development in Madagascar. MNP’s mission is to establish, conserve, and sustainably manage a network of national parks and reserves that represent Madagascar’s biological diversity and natural heritage. A key part of this mission is conserving protected areas while involving local communities in various conservation activities.

                        <br><br>Without tourists to the national park, MNP is unable to operate under optimal conditions. And unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has decimated the ecotourism industry across Madagascar. Prior to the pandemic, Ranomafana National Park received close to 19,000 international visitors annually. Post-pandemic, the park has received closer to 3,500 international visitors annually. This is close to a 70% decrease in tourists, and has meant financial strain for not only MNP’s biodiversity conservation goals, but for the people in town who work at the hotels, restaurants, and shops that cater to visitors. 
                        <br><br>Your visit is a small but incredibly meaningful part to restoring what the pandemic took from Madagascar. Your presence is valued and you are very welcome here.
